# unbounded-hessian-code

Julia code for the paper Complexity of trust-region methods with unbounded Hessian approximations for smooth and nonsmooth optimization.
Use the Project.toml and Manifest.toml files to recover the packages used for the tests, because we use a fork of RegularizedOptimization.jl.
